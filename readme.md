## Notes 
### CountDown clock settings. 

The header clock countdown tool is driven by a global controller abstract
```
/application/default/controllers/ControllerAbstract.php
```

It is a 24 hour clock with a date. 
```
$timeEnd = mktime(15, 0, 0, 8, 10, 2016);
```
Format: mktime(24h, min, sec, M, D, Y);



### Event Arguments
Event arguments are located in 2 places. One front end, the other admin backend.  This controls the event location, task type, and age restrictions. Both files should have the same arguments. 
 ```
/application/default/controllers/EventsController.php
/application/admin/controllers/EventsController.php
```
